# GroovyScript Docs
This is the official repository for the GroovyScript Documentation using Read the Docs and MkDocs

## Test locally
Run the following from a terminal
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

mkdocs serve
```
`pip install` installs the required dependencies and `mkdocs serve` builds and runs the doc on a local server.\
After that simply open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in a browser. It automatically refreshes when you save files.
